# NFL Super Bowl LIII
## Predictive Modeling and Game Simulation via R

Attached you will find the NFL data sets and R code used to run a Poisson regression, game simulation, with code that can help you animate your charts via Plotly and gganimate (both wrapped around the R's powerfull ggplot2). If you have any questions or find areas for improvement, feel free to reach out.

**Conclusions**
* Our predictions indicate that Super Bowl 53 will be an extremely close game
* Even with the New England Patriots having the home-team advantage (due to heavier fanbase predicted to be Super Bowl 53), they're projected to lose
* Our regression analysis and simulations favor the Los Angeles Rams narrowly leading with a final score of 15-14
* The Rams have a 53.6% chance of winning with the score of 15-14
